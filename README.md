## üõ†Ô∏è Project Implementation
The project was implemented in ServiceNow with the following components:  

### 1. Creating Users  
Users represent individuals in the system. Two users were created:  
- **Katherine Pierce** ‚Äì Member of the Certificates Group.  
- **Manne Niranjan** ‚Äì Member of the Platform Group.

### 2. Creating Groups  
Groups represent teams that handle tickets:  
- **Certificates Group** ‚Äì Handles certificate-related issues.  
- **Platform Group** ‚Äì Handles login issues, 404 errors, and expired accounts.

### 3. Creating Roles  
Roles define permissions:  
- **Certificate_role** ‚Äì Grants certificate issue handling access.  
- **Platform_role** ‚Äì Grants platform issue handling access.

### 4. Creating Table & Choices  
A custom table **Operations related** was created with fields:  
- Issue, Description, Assigned To, Status.  

Choices for the **Issue field**:  
- Unable to login to platform  
- 404 error  
- Regarding certificates  
- Regarding user expired

### 5. Assigning Users & Roles to Groups  
- **Certificates Group:** Katherine Pierce + Certificate_role  
- **Platform Group:** Manne Niranjan + Platform_role

### 6. Assigning Roles to Table  
Both **Certificate_role** and **Platform_role** were assigned **Read/Write access** to the *Operations related* table.

### 7. Creating ACLs  
Access Control Lists (ACLs) were defined for sensitive fields (e.g., Issue, Priority, Ticket Raised Date) to restrict access to authorized roles (admin).  
<img width="1390" height="480" alt="acl" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0422dc59-470a-4677-b1d6-e89ba3708212" />


### 8. Creating Flows for Ticket Assignment  
- **Flow 1:** Assign *‚ÄúRegarding Certificates‚Äù* tickets to the Certificates Group.  
- **Flow 2:** Assign *Platform-related issues* (Login, 404 Error, User Expired) to the Platform Group.
